== About ==
This is a mostly-functional Puppet script repo.  Originally written by yours
truly for use at different places of employment.  Scripts were based off of
examples I found on the net, or my own personal needs.  Generally I avoided
the big complex (and pre-written) modules I found online because I wanted to
learn how to do it myself.  All of the scripts work (to my knowledge) but 
again, may lack features or functionality of the larger modules you find
elsewhere.

If you're looking to learn how to Puppet script from the ground up, I hope
my scripts help.  If you're looking for the most awesome pre-built, totally 
complete solutions... please look elsewhere.

Please note: All of these scripts were written to target a uniform Ubuntu 
11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) server environment.  So all file locations will be
Ubuntu specific (should handle anything within a few version of 11.10).
All sample files includes (IE sshd_config) were copied from 11.10, generally
with minimal editing.  I suggest you copy in your own files, but I've left
these examples so you _could_ have a fully functional environment (but please 
don't, for your own security/safety).
