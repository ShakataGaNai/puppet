== About ==
This is a mostly-functional Puppet script repo.  Originally written by yours
truly for use at different places of employment.  Scripts were based off of
examples I found on the net, or my own personal needs.  Generally I avoided
the big complex (and pre-written) modules I found online because I wanted to
learn how to do it myself.  All of the scripts work (to my knowledge) but 
again, may lack features or functionality of the larger modules you find
elsewhere.

If you're looking to learn how to Puppet script from the ground up, I hope
my scripts help.  If you're looking for the most awesome pre-built, totally 
complete solutions... please look elsewhere.
